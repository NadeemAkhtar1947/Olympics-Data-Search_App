# 🏅 Olympic Games Analysis

Welcome to the Olympic Games Analysis project! 🎉 This project performs a detailed analysis of the Olympic Games data, including insights into both the Summer and Winter Olympics. Using **Streamlit** for interactive visualizations, users can explore medal tallies, top athletes, trends over time, and more! 🌍🏅

## Overview

This project aims to provide insights into Olympic Games data to identify key trends and patterns, such as:

- **Medal counts** for each country 🏆
- **Top athletes** based on medal counts 🏅
- **Performance trends** over time for athletes 📈
- **Comparison** of athletes' performances across years ⚖️

We use Python libraries such as **Streamlit**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Pandas** for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis. 📊

## Features

🔹 **Medal Tally Visualization**: Display the distribution of medals across countries.

🔹 **Top Athletes**: Identify top athletes based on total medals earned.

🔹 **Performance Over Time**: Track the performance of individual athletes over multiple Olympic Games.

🔹 **Athlete Comparison**: Compare the performance of two athletes side by side. 🤼

## Datasets

This project uses two datasets representing data from the Olympic Games:

- **summer.csv**: Data for the Summer Olympics 🏖️
- **winter.csv**: Data for the Winter Olympics ❄️

Both datasets contain information about athletes, their countries, events, and medal counts. 🎯
