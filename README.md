# Olympic Games Analysis

This project performs a detailed analysis of the Olympic Games data, including insights into the Summer and Winter Olympics. Using Streamlit for interactive visualizations, the app allows users to explore medal tallies, top athletes, trends over time, and comparisons across different Olympic years.

## Overview

The primary goal of this project is to analyze Olympic Games data to identify key trends and patterns, such as:

- **Total medal counts** for each country.
- **Top athletes** based on medal counts.
- **Performance trends** over time for individual athletes.
- **Comparison** of athletes' performances.

This project uses Python libraries such as Streamlit, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis.

## Features

- **Medal Tally Visualization**: Display the distribution of medals for each country.
- **Top Athletes Visualization**: Identify top athletes based on total medal counts.
- **Performance Over Time**: Track individual athletesâ€™ performances across various Olympic Games.
- **Athlete Comparison**: Compare the performance of two athletes over time.

## Datasets

The project uses two CSV datasets representing data from the Summer and Winter Olympic Games:

- **summer.csv**: Data for the Summer Olympics.
- **winter.csv**: Data for the Winter Olympics.

Both datasets include details about athletes, their countries, event participation, and medal counts.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/olympic-games-analysis.git
    cd olympic-games-analysis
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

   The `requirements.txt` file contains the necessary libraries for this project, including:

   - `streamlit`
   - `pandas`
   - `matplotlib`
   - `seaborn`

4. **Download the Olympic datasets** (if they are not included in the repo). Make sure that the following files are available in your project directory:

   - `summer.csv`
   - `winter.csv`

## Usage

1. To run the Streamlit app, execute the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

2. The app will open in your default web browser. You can interact with the app, select different options, and explore the Olympic data visualizations.
